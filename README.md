PROJECT NAME:-
 CREDIT CARD ANALYSIS USING POWER BI & MYSQL

Introduction:-
The financial industry generates vast amounts of transactional and customer-related data daily. Effective analysis and automation of this data can unlock valuable insights that drive business decisions. This project focuses on Credit Card Analysis, leveraging Power BI for visualization and reporting and MySQL for data management and automation. The dataset includes customer demographics, credit card details, and transaction histories, providing a comprehensive view of customer behaviour and credit card performance. By integrating MySQL and Power BI, this project aims to create a seamless system for dynamic data visualization and real-time insights.

Overview:-
This project involves two main components:
1.	Data Analysis and Visualization: Using Power BI, detailed dashboards are created to provide insights into customer demographics, credit card usage patterns, revenue trends, and customer satisfaction scores. These dashboards empower stakeholders with a clear understanding of key performance indicators (KPIs).
2.	Automation with MySQL: MySQL is employed to manage, clean, and inject data into Power BI. Automated workflows are set up to ensure real-time updates to dashboards as new data becomes available. This integration reduces manual efforts and ensures data accuracy and timeliness.

Objective:-
1.	Analyse Credit Card Data: Extract meaningful insights from credit card usage patterns and customer demographics to understand behaviour and trends.
2.	Create Dynamic Dashboards: Develop interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key metrics such as revenue, transactions, credit utilization, and customer satisfaction.
3.	Automate Data Workflow: Utilize MySQL to automate the data pipeline, ensuring timely and accurate data injection into Power BI for real-time insights.
4.	Improve Decision-Making: Provide stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize customer engagement strategies, minimize delinquency risks, and enhance profitability.
